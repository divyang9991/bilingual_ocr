## 📌 Project Summary

This project is a custom-built **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** system that extracts printed text from **images or scanned documents** in both **English** and **Gujarati**. With a strong focus on **lightweight deployment** and **low-resource compatibility**, this system is ideal for use in:

- Rural offices with legacy hardware
- Government digitization efforts
- Regional language text processing
- Form digitization and automation

The system combines **Tesseract OCR** and **EasyOCR**, enhanced through image preprocessing, text block alignment, and adaptive segmentation for regional scripts.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 🔤 **Supports English and Gujarati scripts**
- 📈 **>90% average accuracy** on noisy or scanned printed text
- 🧠 **Hybrid OCR engine** using both Tesseract and EasyOCR
- 🪄 **Enhanced alignment + preprocessing pipeline** using OpenCV
- 🧩 Modular architecture: easily extensible to more Indian languages
- 🪶 Lightweight deployment, runs smoothly on older machines
